                <h3>DHT11</h3>
                <p class="description">The DHT11 is a basic, ultra-low-cost digital temperature and humidity sensor. It uses a capacitive humidity sensor and a thermistor to measure the surrounding air, and spits out a digital signal on the data pin (no analog input pins needed). It's simple to use, but requires careful timing to grab data. The only real downside of this sensor is that you can only get new data from it once every 2 seconds, so when using our library, sensor readings can be up to 2 seconds old. However, it has excellent long-term stability and is one of the most common sensors used in DIY projects for environmental monitoring.</p>

                <h3>LDR</h3>
                <p class="description">A Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) is a passive electronic component that has a resistance that varies depending on the amount of light falling on its surface. LDRs are made from high resistance semiconductor materials. When light falls upon the LDR, the resistance changes, causing a change in the voltage across the component, which can be measured. LDRs are commonly used in light-sensing circuits, such as automatic street lights, light meters in cameras, and many other devices where light measurement is required. They are known for their simple design and reliable operation in various lighting conditions.</p>
